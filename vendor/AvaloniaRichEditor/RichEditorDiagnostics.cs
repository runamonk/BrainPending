/// decode, a clipboard flavor the source app lied about, a text layout that rejects a metrics query
/// mid-resize. Each has a defined fallback, and none of them should interrupt the user. The problem
/// was that a HOST had no way to see any of it — a paste that quietly did nothing looked identical to
/// a paste of nothing. Subscribing to <see cref="Fault"/> makes those visible without changing what
/// the control does about them.</para>
/// <para>Each distinct fault — one <c>catch</c> site, one exception type — is reported ONCE. Several
/// of these sites sit in the render and caret-metrics paths, where a persistent fault would otherwise
/// fire many times a second and bury everything else. Call <see cref="Reset"/> to re-arm.</para>
/// <para>This is a diagnostic channel, not an error-handling one: the fallback has already happened by
/// the time the event fires, and nothing a handler does changes it. A handler that throws is ignored.
/// Handlers may be invoked on a background thread (image decoding and document parsing run off the UI
/// thread), so marshal before touching UI.</para>
/// <para>The event is static and holds its subscribers for the life of the process — unsubscribe when
/// the host shuts down if it would otherwise keep an object graph alive.</para></summary>
