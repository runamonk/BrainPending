/// the clipboard — into a <see cref="FlowDocument"/>: paragraphs, bold/italic/underline/strike,
/// font size, foreground colour, embedded images (<c>\pict</c> PNG/JPEG, bytes carried inline), and
/// simple tables (<c>\trowd…\cell…\row</c>). Unlike Word's CF_HTML (which references temp files for
/// images), RTF embeds the image bytes, so nothing is lost. Zero external dependencies beyond a
/// code-page provider for CJK text (<c>\'hh</c> bytes are decoded with the document's <c>\ansicpg</c>).
/// <para>Writing covers more than reading, because that is what other applications consume: merged cells
/// (<c>\clmgf</c>/<c>\clmrg</c>, <c>\clvmgf</c>/<c>\clvmrg</c>), per-cell shading (<c>\clcbpat</c>),
/// everything a cell holds (several paragraphs, images, dividers, list markers), and tables nested in a
/// cell (<c>\nestcell</c>/<c>\nestrow</c>, read back as a real nested table). Reading back is still
/// lossier in places: cell merge flags and shading are ignored, and a nested table's column widths come
/// out at the default because they live in the ignorable <c>{\*\nesttableprops}</c> group. An
/// <see cref="InlineTable"/> has no RTF equivalent, so it is written as a
/// block-level table that splits its host paragraph — the content and its order survive, the in-line
